# Solidity_21BCS5650
In this project I have created a token named as "Happy" and token abbreviation as "hpy".Initially I have initialized the totalsupply to 0.
Then I have mapped addresses to balances.I have created a mint function which uses to parameters as address and value which are used to
increase the address by that value and also the totalsupply by that same amount.The second function which is the mint function is just opposite of the 
mint function it decreases the totalsupply and the balance of the sender by the given or required amount.
